# UE4-Single-Player-Demo


LEET Single player game demo.  

Full How-to coming soon!


Objective:

Build a game in Unreal Engine 4 which uses the LEET admission fee service.

Detail:

LEET provides a simple API endpoint which allows developers to charge players on a per-play basis.  We are going to be using this to make a single person arcade game.

Strategy:

We will be building a simple single person game.  The player will open the exe and enter some information on a connect screen.  The game will start, the player will be charged for the play. When the player dies, the game will end.  

Requirements:

A developer account on the LEET sandbox:   leet.gg
Unreal Engine 4.11 or higher 
Windows 7 or higher with MS Visual Studio 2015
